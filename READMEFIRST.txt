Hello! This downloadable little thing is a very useful tool that you can use to somewhat bypass some of the harsh laws put in by blocksi, and the schools proxy. Now I know it may be tempting to go and click on the games.html file, but to access the rest of the tools you need to press index.html because of coding reasons, and also I'm too lazy to go back and change the pointers for everything, so take your developing brain and use it to click on the right thing.
